Project 6

1.  Convert a String from uppercase to lowercase ✔	

2. How are these different?
 
  a = “Bob”
  
  : perhaps the easiest way to create a string is to simply assign a string to a variable name. 
  Ruby then takes care of the rest for you as in the above. 
  
  b = String.new(“Bob”)
  
  :In the above a new string is created and initialized by passing through a string as an argument to the new method.
 
3. Replace all the a’s in this sentence with x’s ✔	
   “Mary had a little lamb” i.e. “Mxry hxd x little lxmb”
   
4. Convert a String to an Array of Characters ✔	
   i.e. “Bob” [‘B’,’o’,’b’]
   
5. How is “gsub” different from “gsub!”? ✔	
"gsub!" is important because it modifies the existing object.

6. How is ‘bob’ different from :bob ? ✔	

The truth of the matter is that Symbols are Strings, just with an important difference, 
Symbols are immutable. Mutable objects can be changed after assignment while immutable objects can only be overwritten.
